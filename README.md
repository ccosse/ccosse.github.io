This is my latest project called Reading Edge.  You can try it <a href="https://ccosse.github.io">Here</a>.
Reading Edge trains kids to read carefully by having them reconstruct a series of paragraphs. For each paragraph
there are 3 steps: Read, Repair and Reward.  First they read a straightforward paragraph, a good length is about 
50-100 words.  Second, a percentage of words are chosen at random and thrown into a "bag of words" that need to
be put back into the right place.  Third, after correctly repairing the paragraph, collect a reward of 1 point 
per word corrected.  The all-or-nothing stakes provide incentive to make an effort and read carefully. Each retry
is re-scrambled, as well.  You set the exchange rate for what "1 point" is worth, ie maybe they can buy their way
out of doing chores, or compete for prizes, or just simply avoid being locked-up and electrocuted. (just kidding)

That's the process, but where does the reading material come from?  Indeed, content was always a problem. But that
problem has been solved by integrating Wikipedia components directly into Reading Edge. Now you can quickly and easily 
create reading assignments having quality content that will occupy and challenge your students for hours.

Reading Edge terminology goes like this: each paragraph is part of a <i>page</i>. A page also contains images
and page-configuration data.  An <i>assignment</i> is a list of pages, and a <i>course</i> is a collection of
assignments and <i>students</i>.  When you click the "New Assignment" button at the top of the Teacher Dashboard,
the resulting assignment object has a default configuration which will present random Wikipedia summaries until 
the points-goal is reached or the user exits the assignment. You can add comma-separated <i>guide-words</i> to
guide your Wikipedia results. 

Here's a quick setup.  First, login using your GMail. This creates your storage space and directs you to the Teacher 
Dashboard.  At top center you click to add a new course.  In the course, you click to create a new assignment.  Edit the 
assignment and provide one or more comma-separated guide-words.  You are done, except that you don't have any students yet.
Share your course-key with anyone you like. They can login and go to the <i>Student Dashboard</i> to enter the course-key
and enroll themselves.  From there they can earn points via the assignments you prepare and assign to them.  

Your account has both a Teacher and a Student side, so you can enroll in the course you just created and experience 
as a student first-hand.

The app also works in multiple languages with both text and speech support. The speech part is separate from Wikipedia
language controls, but Reading Edge connects the right Wikipedia content, in various languages, with the correct 
voice for speech playback.  Current languages are: English (US), English (UK), German, Italian, French, Indonesian, Russian,
Thai (but using id speech-voice), Chinese (MD,TW,HK), Kiswahili, Portuguese (BR), Spanish and Korean.
