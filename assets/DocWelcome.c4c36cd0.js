For each paragraph there are 3 steps: Read, Repair and Reward. First they read a straightforward paragraph, a good length is about 30-60 words. Second, a percentage of words are chosen at random and thrown into a "bag of words" that need to be put back into the right place. Third, after correctly repairing the paragraph, collect a reward of 1 point per word corrected. The all-or-nothing stakes provide incentive to make an effort and read carefully. Each retry is re-scrambled, as well. You set the exchange rate for what "1 point" is worth, ie maybe they can buy their way out of doing chores, or compete for prizes, or just simply avoid being locked-up and electrocuted.
