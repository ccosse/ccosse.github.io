  Addressed confusing right sidebar navigation by eliminating
  label at top of ea corresponding pager (that looked like a 
  button) and replacing with a more logical "return to <level>" 
  up-arrow button at top of stack.

  Example: when looking at an assignment with 5 pages, now we
  don't show a label at top of those 5 page tiles saying "5 pages"
  as that label did nothing and had the appearance of a button.

  The remaining stack really are active buttons to navigate the
  course-assignment-page-image hierarchy.

  Also added prev/next buttons to page label of rh-sb stack.

  Cut demo assignment length down to ~10 pgs for each to make
  easier to complete and award points.  (currently no partial
  credit, so long assignments were a drawback to many users)

  Added "delete page" button to each page on right sidebar's
  Page Pager, when showing pages of an assignment; still need
  to use the Save button to save changes to cloud. Note that
  there is no confirmation dialog for this action.

  You can now import + export assignments, for example
  goto any demo assignment and export to clipboard, then
